# Basic-Portfolio
Week 1 homework


This assignment was homework 1. I added some finishing touches and cleaned the repository. Overall I'm not quite satisfied with the work, and would like to add more features to the portfolio. I will use Bootstrap in the next assignment.

Some of the challenges I found were trying to get the margins to where I want them. I spent hours on the margins and height/width of each of the elements like the body and side panel. The footer was tough to get it flush to the bottom. I did some research and tried to get it to where I want it. Still want to improve the coding of the html page some more.
